Ruby Notes

To create a new column in the table Statuses, I did this:

rails generate migration add_user_id_to_statuses

Then I went into the DB, migration file and added this

class AddUserIdToStatuses < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
  add_column :statuses, :user_id, :integer
  add_index :statuses, :user_id
  remove_column :statuses, :name
  end
end

I then re-ran this command:

rake db:migrate

GIT

https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo

"git init" within the project folder to create the GIT repo
"git add ."  to add all to repo in the folder
"git commit -m "commit message" to stage
create a project on GitHub
"git remote add origin https://github.com/alienlan/name" to add remote
"git push origin master" to push to origin master

So, if I want get changes from the remote repository called “origin” into my local repository I’ll type git fetch origin and you might see some output like this:
